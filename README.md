## Office hours:Thursday 17:00 - 18:00 (email required) 

## Overview 
* Attendance will be marked by the submission of the problem set for each lecture. It should be submitted by the end of the day of the corresponding class (No late submission allowed). 
* If the problem set is not submitted by the time, it will be assumed as you are absent.
* Google accounts will be required (for Colab). 
* The dates of Mid/Final exams can be changed depending on the pandemic/school situations. 
* Depending on the COVID situation, this lecture can be changed to the live remote class. However, it will be the in-person class mainly. 
* There will be four Homeworks. 
* Mid exam 25%/ Final exam 25%/ Assignments 25%/ Attendance 20%/ Helpers 5%

## Be sure 
* HW can be solved with others. *BUT* you should list names of people who helped you and how they helped you. If not, there will be 50% of score reduction. 
* It's same for the problem sets. 
* Copying other's code will be scored zero. No excuse. 
* Due date and time is not negotiable. 

## Problem set
* Add your explanation via comments '#' 
* All code should be run in principle. 
* If your code has an error and you couldn't finish it, explain what you've tried to solve the error + your guess related to the errors. 

## Homeworks 
* Problem set can include some errors, however, HW should be run properly. 
* If not, score will be deducted. 

## Communicate via Slack 
* address: https://join.slack.com/t/20221programming1/shared_invite/zt-14b50liia-5EJDCkVmXQp3oq_YRICoUg
* (this address will be expired in 30 days) 
* You can ask a quesion about the HW and problem sets to other class mates (I might not be slow to answer, so in that case use the office hour). 
* Please list the people who helped you to solve the problem. 
* The people who helped (normalized frequency) will get an additional 5% score for 'Helpers': The list of helpers will be counted right before the mid term and it will be reset. And it will be re-counted beteween mid-final exam period.
